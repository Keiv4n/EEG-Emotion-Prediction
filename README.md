# EEG-Emotion-Recognition
Brain-Computer Interface course project (Electroencephalography-Based Human Emotion Prediction Using Deep Learning).

### Project Aims & Objectives:
The goal of this project is to provide electroencephalography (EEG) approaches for emotion recognition. EEG signals are collected from the brainâ€™s scalp and analyzed in response to a variety of stimuli representing the three main emotions. Human emotions are varied and complex but can be generalized into positive, neutral and negative categories.

### Dataset:
[EEG Brainwave Dataset: Feeling Emotions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/birdy654/eeg-brainwave-dataset-feeling-emotions) which is publicly available. This dataset contains 3 class label for emotion (neutral, happy, and sad). Moreover, the dataset is preprocessed and some featues are extracted as follows:
